**This site** is my personal website.  Everything - content, icons, CSS/web design, etc. - is made
from scratch by me.  All pages are completely static HTML, with no javascript and the bare minimum
CSS.  I'm using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) to simplify site generation (with
[Tera](https://github.com/Keats/tera) for templating) and this site is hosted using GitHub pages.
