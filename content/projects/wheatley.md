Wheatley is a product of my long summer holiday in 2020.  I'm sure the year 2020 will be imprinted
in everyone's memories as the year the world was put on pause, so it goes without saying that not
much was happening that summer.

The biggest effect of COVID on from my routine that summer was the not-so-unexpected loss of my main
hobby - ringing church bells.  Anyone who's been ringing will see the problem - ringing requires
people to stand in close company in poorly ventalated rooms for large periods of time, which is not
exactly compatible with COVID.

However, not to be put off by something as small as a global epidemic, ringing does continue.  Two
American ringers created a way for us to 'ring' together whilst not leaving our homes.  The result
is ['Ringing Room'](https://ringingroom.com), a website that simulates ringing real bells by allowing
multiple ringers to make the sounds of real life bells and have those sounds syncronised across all
the ringers in a 'room'.  I say 'ring' in quotes here, because ringing on Ringing Room leaves
something to be desired when compared to 'real' ringing (this is not a criticism of Ringing Room -
I, and many many other people, are incredibly grateful to Bryn and Leland for the ability to keep
our hobby going).

However, online ringing does present some unique opportunites - like the fact that for the first
time, it is fairly straightforward for a computer program to interact with human ringers in a
(hopefully) constructive way.
